> **Note**
>
> The ownership of the `openai` package on crates.io has been transfered to me, Valentine Briese (not the previous owner).
> This is an entirely different project than the one that was on crates.io as `openai` previously!

> **Warning**
> 
> Currently in alpha, I wouldn't recommend using in any production applications.
